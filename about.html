			Born and raised in the city that never sleeps, I came across the coding world about a year ago. Working as a receptionist at a tech firm, I had developed an interest while watching developers work on the company websites and among other tweaks. Then I discovered the New York Code and Design Academy and decided to enroll in classes. So far I have learned Html and CSS, being able to change fonts and backgrounds and be creative with the websites that I can build. A side from my personal website, I am also developing a side project called " The Lingerie Chef" you can learn more about that in my News tab above. I hope to create more websites in the future using the skills I have aquired in my class.
